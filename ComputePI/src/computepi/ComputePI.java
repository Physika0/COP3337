|  Description:  The progam's purpose is to compute PI utilizing the Leibniz    
|                formula which can be found on page 29 in the book Big Java, 
|                Early Objects by Cay Horstmann. The program will calculate this 
|                up to the sixth decimal place. The formula is as follows:
|                   
|                Ï€/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - ...
|
|        Input:  No input is supplied by the user.  
|  
|       Output:  The program should output the expected value of PI (which in 
|                this case is 3.141593), the computed value of PI (which is 
|                computed using the Leibniz formula for PI), and number of 
|                iterations it took to get to this computation. These are all
|                printed on the screen in their own individual lines.
|  
|      Process:  The program goes through the following steps:
|                
|                1. The first iteration is counted before any compution occurs.
|
|                2. It then checks if the iteration number is odd so that it may
|                   alternate between subtracting or adding to the computed 
|                   value as required by the Leibniz formula.
|
|                3. The program then adds 2 to the number to be divided by so 
|                   that each addition or subtraction happens with fractions
|                   with an odd number denominator.
|
|                4. It then checks if the absolute value of the difference 
|                   between the expected value and the computed value is less
|                   than DELTA, DELTA being the meaningful difference between
|                   PI and the expected value (this is determined to be 
|                   0.0000004). If it is true, the loop will stop.
|
|                5. The expected value, computed value, and number of iterations
|                   are displayed in each individual line.
|
|                   The computations rely on the Leibniz formula for PI.
|  
|   Required Features Not Included:  
|                All of the required features are in the program.  
|  
|   Known Bugs:  There does not appear to be any bugs in the code.
